    "The inspiration for the world's best port and terminal data analysis project came from wanting to venture past my comfort zone and gain insights into the backbone of logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data analysis project's primary purpose is to pinpoint which major ports and terminals in the world excel above all those included in the dataset. The metrics, i.e., data fields, will be used to thoroughly reveal which ports have claimed top positions in terms of the various categories present in the dataset, which include location, physical characteristics, available facilities, and services offered. The analysis will also provide valuable insights for anyone interested in the maritime industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was sourced from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a federal agency in the United States. The agency validates, updates, and maintains the data. The data is updated monthly.\n",
