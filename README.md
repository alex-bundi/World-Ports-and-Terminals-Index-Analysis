# World Port and Terminal Index Analysis

This project aims to analyze the World Port and Terminal Index to identify which major ports and terminals in the world excel above all those included in the dataset. 
The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, and the following libraries were used:
> * pandas
> * matplotlib
> * camelot (supported by Ghostscript, tkinter, and pypdf <3.0.0)

## Dataset

The World Ports and Terminals Index and Countries-Continents dataset was used for this project. 
The dataset contains data fields related to location, physical characteristics, available facilities, and services offered by various ports and terminals.

## Analysis

The data was analyzed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Various data analysis techniques were used to thoroughly reveal which ports have claimed top positions regarding the various categories present in the dataset.
### Dependencies
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:
> * pandas
> * matplotlib
